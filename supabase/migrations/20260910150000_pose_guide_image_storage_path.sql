-- Makes pose image ownership metadata-driven instead of inferred from the
-- image_url string at delete time. Previously the admin page decided
-- whether it was safe to delete a pose's old image object by checking
-- whether the URL happened to contain the pose-images bucket's public-URL
-- marker -- correct today, but fragile: any future bucket rename, CDN
-- fronting, or URL rewrite would silently break the ownership check (either
-- leaking storage by never deleting, or worse, deleting something it
-- shouldn't). image_storage_path is instead set explicitly, once, at the
-- moment this feature itself uploads an object -- an authoritative marker,
-- not a runtime inference. NULL means "this feature does not own the
-- current image", which covers both the 4 originally-seeded poses (borrowed
-- product photos, never owned) and any row saved before this column
-- existed -- no backfill is possible or safe for that population, since we
-- cannot know retroactively which of them were actually uploaded here.
ALTER TABLE public.pose_guides
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS image_storage_path text;

COMMENT ON COLUMN public.pose_guides.image_storage_path IS
  'Storage object path in the pose-images bucket, set only when this feature uploaded the current image_url. NULL means the image is borrowed/foreign or predates this column -- never delete it.';

-- Extend save_pose_guide to accept and persist the ownership marker
-- alongside the image URL, atomically with everything else it already
-- writes. Adding a 13th parameter makes this a distinct overload as far as
-- CREATE OR REPLACE is concerned, not a replacement of the 12-arg version --
-- drop the old signature explicitly so callers can't accidentally resolve
-- to it and so PostgREST's named-argument RPC lookup stays unambiguous.
