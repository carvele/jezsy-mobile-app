-- get_public_outfits_for_product -- it does no elevated-privilege work, both
-- pose_guides and pose_guide_products are already fully public-SELECT, so
-- this RPC can't return anything a direct SELECT wouldn't already allow.
-- sort_order was an unused column on pose_guides until now; ordering by it
-- first gives admins deliberate editorial control instead of an implicit
-- created_at ordering.
